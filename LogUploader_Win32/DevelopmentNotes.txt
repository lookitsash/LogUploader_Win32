We require support for osx 10.8 (and newer) and windows xp (and newer).

The application executable for both operating systems should be small (~1Mb but this isn't a hard limit) and standalone (it must be a one click executable - a .exe for win and a .dmg for osx). The application must be digitally signed. We know how to do this for exe's on Windows but not .dmgs on osx (but have the appropriate certificates to do this).
